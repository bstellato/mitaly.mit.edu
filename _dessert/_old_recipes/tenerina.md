Recipe by Lorenzo De Santis.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients
* Dark chocolate: 200 g (0.44 lb)
* Unsalted butter: 100 g (0.22 lb)
* Eggs: 4
* Sugar: 150 g (0.33 lb)
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 50 g (1.8 oz)
* Powdered sugar

## Preparation
1. Finely chop the chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie, while stirring continuously. When the chocolate is fully melted, add the chopped butter and stir. When also the butter is melted, remove the mixture from the heat.
2. While the chocolate and butter mixture is cooling down, separate the egg yolks from the egg whites in two different mixing bowls and add half of the sugar to each of them.
3. Whisk the egg whites with sugar until stiff and put to one side.
4. Whisk the egg yolks with sugar, then pour the chocolate and butter mixture while continuously whisking, until an homogeneous compound is obtained.
5. Add the stiff egg whites to the chocolate mixture, and gently blend everything.
6. Pour the flour and continue blending in order to obtain a smooth batter.
7. Butter the baking tray and pour the batter inside.
8. Heat the oven at 180 C (355 F) and cook for 30-35 minutes.
9. Once out of the oven, let the cake cool down and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Recipe by Nicola Martino.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients

* Eggs: 8
* Sugar: 100 g (0.22 lb)
* Espresso coffee: 2 cups
* Mascarpone: 250 g (0.55 lb)
* Ladyfingers: 500 g (1.1 lb)
* Rum: 1 tbs (optional)
* Dark chocolate powder

## Preparation
1. Prepare the coffee and let it cool down.
2. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Beat the whites until obtaining a stiff foam.
3. Mix the yolks with the sugar and whisk until a pale, firm cream is obtained. While keeping whisking, slowly add the mascarpone. Optionally flavor with the rum.
4. With a spatula, slowly add the egg whites foam to the cream, taking care not to overmix to avoid breaking down the foam.
5. Take the pan. Quickly dip the ladyfingers into the coffee and dispose them in a single layer in the pan. Cover with half of the cream. Repeat the procedure for the second layer.
6. Put the tiramisu in the fridge and let it rest for at least 3 hours.
7. Just before serving, sprinkle the tiramisu with a layer of powdered chocolate.

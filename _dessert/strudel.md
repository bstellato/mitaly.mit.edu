## Preparation
1. Peel the apples and cut them in small pieces. Cut figs and plums in tiny slices.
2. In a pot, melt the butter and roast the pine nuts for few minutes, then add apples, sultanas, figs, plums sugar, cinnamon and the whole lemon peel.
3. Cook until the apple are soft but still have a shape (the cooking time depends on the apples type and the size of the pieces, we are not looking for jam texture!). Drain the excess juice
4. Arrange apple filling down the middle of the pastry lengthwise. Fold the pastry lengthwise around the mixture. Seal edges of pastry
5. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Enjoy!

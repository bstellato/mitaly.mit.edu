Recipe by Simone Bruno.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 350 g (0.66 lb)
* Butter: 150 g (0.33 lb)
* Egg yolks: 3
* Sugar: 90 g (3.2 oz)
* Jam: 400 gr (0.88 lb)
* Lemon: 1
* Salt

## Preparation
1. Put on a clean surface flour, sugar, eggs, the zest of one lemon and butter. Knead all the ingredients together and form a ball. Wrap it with aluminium foil and store in the fridge for 30 minutes.
2. Prepare a baking pan (22 cm diameter) rubbed with butter and flour.
3. Roll the pastry with a rolling pin and lay it in the baking pan. With a fork, punch small holes in the pastry to avoid it bubbling during cooking.
4. Pour the jam on top of the pastry and put in oven for 30/35 minutes at 180Â°C.
5. Decorate the crostata with powdered sugar, let it cool down and serve.

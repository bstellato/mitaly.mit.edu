Recipe by Nicoletta Inverardi.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients

### Custard
* Whole milk: 500 g (2 cups)
* Egg yolks: 4
* Sugar: 130 g (0.3 lb)
* Corn starch: 40 g (1.4 oz)
* Lemon: 1 (peel)
* Vanilla pod: 1



### Cannoncini
* Puff pastry: 1 roll
* Sugar: 2 tbsp
* Egg: 1 yolk
* Chopped hazelnuts



## Preparation
1. Pour milk in a pan adding vanilla seeds and lemon peel. Heat the milk until boiling and then let it cool down.
2. In a bowl mix and whisk yolks with sugar and corn starch. When it is smooth, pour it in the milk and mix till the cream thickens. Boil for three minutes, let cool: the cream is ready.
3. Put the home-made puff pastry on a floured surface (or roll out the store puff pastry sheet) and cut strips of 1cm width each. Roll up each stripe on a steel corn and brush it with beaten egg yolk.
4. Sprinkle each cannoncino with sugar. Put the cannoncini over their molds on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake for about 15 minutes at 350F.
5. When the cannoncini are cold, carefully remove them and fill with the custard cream using a sac Ã  poche.
6. Dip the cannoncini in the chopped hazelnuts in order to seal the side filled with the cream.

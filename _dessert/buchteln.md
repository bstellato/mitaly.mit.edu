Recipe by Bianca Giovanardi.

## Ingredients
* Milk: 270 ml (1 ⅛ cups)
* Baking powder: 8 g (½ tbs)
* Egg: 1
* Brown sugar: 130 g (0.28 lb)
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 500 g (1.1 lb)
* Sunflower oil: 30 ml (2 tbs)
* Lemon: 1
* Vanilla extract
* Jam: a lot!!

## Preparation
1. Melt the baking powder in warm milk with two teaspoons of sugar.
2. Put in a bowl the sugar, the egg, the flour, the vanilla flavor, the grated lemon peel, and the oil. Add the milk and start kneading. Continue to knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
3. Let the dough rise for two hours in a warm place. Once the dough has risen, divide the dough into small pieces of approximately 60 g (0.13 lb) each and let the pieces rise again for one hour.
4. Once the pieces of dough have risen, use a rolling pin to flatten them. On each of them put the jam and wrap them keeping the jam inside.
5. Put them into the oven at 190°C for 15 minutes. Enjoy!

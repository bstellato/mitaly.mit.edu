Recipe by Filippo Rossignoli.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients
* Dark chocolate: 200 g (0.44 lb)
* Unsalted butter: 100 g (0.22 lb)
* Eggs: 4
* Sugar: 150 g (0.33 lb)
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 50 g (1.8 oz)
* Powdered sugar

## Preparation
1. Begin by finely chop the chocolate, then transfer it into a metal bowl placed in a pan with water (possibly the water should not come into contact with the bottom of the bowl in which you have poured the chocolate) and melt it in a bain-marie, stirring constantly. Only when the chocolate is already melted, but not too hot, add the butter already cut into small pieces and let it melt too, continuing to stir.
2. Let the chocolate and butter mixture cool, stirring it from time to time, and in the meantime separate the yolks from the whites in two different and capacious bowls. At this point, add half the sugar to the whites and whip them until the mixture is still and frothy.
3. Pour the remaining sugar into the egg yolks, then whip the mixture at moderate speed until it becomes light and fluffy. At this point, with the whips still in action, pour the chocolate and butter mixture and keep beating until you get a uniform compound. At this point add the beaten egg whites a bit at a time stirring gently from bottom to top with a spatula. Add the flour and stir always with a spatula making delicate movements from the bottom upwards until a smooth and uniform compound is obtained.
4. Pour the so obtained dough in a cake mold and bake in a preheated static oven at 180Â°C for 30-35 minutes.
5. Once baked, let it cool slightly then remove from the tin and dust with icing sugar.

Recipe by Bianca Giovanardi.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients

* Apples: 1 kg (2 lb)
* Flour: 180g (0.4 lbs)
* Butter: 140 g (0.3 lb)
* Cane sugar: 190 g (0.4 lbs)
* Lemon: 1


## Preparation
1. Peel the apples and cut them in dices of medium size. Melt 20g of butter in a pan and add the apple dices, the lemon juice, and 70g of sugar. Cook in the pan for approximately one minute.
2. In the meantime, prepare the sbriciolata dough: pour the flour, the remaining 120g of sugar, and the remaining 120g of butter (hand-broken in small pieces) in a bowl. Rub the ingredients with the tip of your fingers to combine the ingredients and evenly distribute the butter in the mixture of flour and sugar.
3. In a baking pan, lay out some butter to avoid the dough to stick to the pan. Put a layer of the sbriciolata dough, then the slightly cooked apples, followed by another layer of the dough. Put in hot oven at 180Â°C for 35/40 minutes, until the surface of the sbriciolata looks crunchy. Remove from oven and serve the sbriciolata well-warmed.
4. Chef Suggestion: serve the warm sbriciolata with vanilla ice-cream or dress with chocolate sauce.

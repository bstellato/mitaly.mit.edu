## Ingredients

### Stuffing
* Sugar: 100 g (0.22 lb)

* Cinnamon: 1 tsp
* Grated lemon peel: 1 tsp

## Preparation
1. Mix all the ingredients for the stuffing in a bowl and let rest for 20 minutes in the fridge.
2. For the short pastry, mix in a bowl with a fork sugar, butter, the egg, the grated lemon peel. In a second bowl mix the baking powder with the flour. Add the powder mix in the first bowl and with the hands create crumbs.

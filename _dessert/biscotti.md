Recipe by Giacomo De Palma.

## Ingredients
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 350 g (0.77 lb)
* Sugar: 150g (0.33 lb)
* Eggs: 2
* Butter: 100g (0.22 lb)
* Baking powder: 1 tbs
* Granulated sugar
* Vanilla extract
* Salt

## Preparation
1. Sift the flour onto the table top. Make a hole in the center and pour in the sugar, a few drops of vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, one entire egg and one egg white (keep the yolk for decoration).
2. Mix the ingredients by incorporating part of the flour to form a thick dough, then add the butter diced into small pieces, the baking powder and incorporate the remaining flour. Knead everything quickly, until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough.
3. Form many rolls of dough as thick as a finger and about 10 cm long, close them in a donut shape and arrange them, spaced, on a oven sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. Brush the biscotti on the surface with the yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon of water and sprinkle with granulated sugar.
5. Cook for 15-20 minutes in the middle part of the preheated oven (electric oven: 190°C, ventilated oven: 180°C, gas oven in the top part: 200°C).

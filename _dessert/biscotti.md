Recipe by Simone Bruno.

## Ingredients
Doses for 18 cookies:
* Granulated sugar-120g (4.2 oz.);
* egg whites-90g (3.2 oz.);
* grated coconut-.150 g (5.3 oz.)

## Preparation
To prepare the coconut cookies, pour the grated coconut in a bowl and add the granulated sugar, mix and add the egg whites. If you want you can add vanilla, honey or chocolate chips. Mix everything thoroughly: you will have to work to obtain a uniform mixture after which transfer it into a sac-à-poche with a 15 mm star nozzle. Use a disposable sac-à-few because the plastic ones rigid could crack: in fact the dough is very tenacious and you will have to squeeze the tufts, on a baking tray already lined with parchment paper, with a little energy. Make the tufts of about 20 grams each, then bake in a convection oven preheated to 200 ° for about 10 minutes or until they are golden brown on the surface. Remove from the oven and let them cool before moving them since they will be soft and hot. Once cold, serve your coconut cookies!

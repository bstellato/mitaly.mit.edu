Recipe by Martina Dal Bello.

(Recipe for a round pan of 22 cm)

## Ingredients

### Stuffing
* Unsalted butter: 35 g (1.2 oz)
* Cooked wheat grain: 400 g (0.88 lb)
* Milk: 300 ml (1 ¼ cups)
* Eggs: 2 + 2 yolks
* Sugar: 350 g (0.77 lb)
* Ricotta cheese: 450 g (1 lb)
* Lemon: 1
* Cinnamon: 1 tsp
* Candied fruit (or chocolate chips)
* Orange flower essence (if you choose candied fruit)

### Pastry crust
* Unsalted butter: 125 g (0.28 lb)
* Flour (00 or all-purpose): 250 g (0.55 lb)
* Eggs: 1 + 1 yolk
* Sugar: 100 g (0.22 lb)
* Vanilla extract
* Salt

## Preparation
1. Put the cooked wheat grain, the milk, the butter and the lemon peel in a pan. Heat to boiling and keep cooking, while stirring continuously, until the mixture becomes a dense cream. Let it cool down.
2. Beat the eggs, the sugar, the ricotta cheese and the cinnamon until the mixture becomes a fluid cream without clumps.
3. Join the two mixtures adding either the candied fruit or the chocolate chips. If you add the candied fruit, add also the orange flower essence. Let the new mixture rest while you prepare the pastry.
4. Put all the ingredients for the pastry on a clean surface, knead them together and form a ball. Wrap it in a clean dishcloth and store it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
5. Prepare a baking pan rubbed with butter and flour. Roll the pastry with a rolling pin and lay it in the baking pan. Leave a bit to make stripes with which you will decorate the pie. With a fork, punch small holes in the pastry to avoid it bubbling during cooking.
7. Pour the stuffing on top of the pastry. Decorate with the stripes.
Put in the oven for 1 hour at 200°C (the surface of the pie be golden). Once the pie is cool, sprinkle it with powdered sugar.

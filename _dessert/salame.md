Recipe by Alice Cosma.

## Ingredients
* Dark chocolate: 200 g (0.44 lb)
* Dry cookies: 175 g (0.38 lb)
* Butter: 150 g (0.33 lb)
* Sugar: 150 g (0.33 lb)
* Eggs: 100 g (0.22 lb)
* Rum: 2 tsp (optional)
* Powdered sugar (for decoration)

## Preparation
1. Cut the chocolate into small pieces and melt it in a bain-marie.
While the melted chocolate cools down, dice the butter (at room temperature) and combine it with the sugar with an electric mixer. Optionally, flavor the mix with the rum.
2. Lightly mix the eggs (at room temperature) in a bowl and slowly add them to the butter and sugar mix while beating with the mixer, until the resulting mixture becomes light and foamy.
3. Add the chocolate (at room temperature) to the mixture and mix until completely combined.
4. Crush the cookies into small pieces and add them to the mixture, combining them with a spoon.
5. Move the mixture on a sheet of parchment paper and roll it to make it into a compact sausage-like shape of about 5 cm in diameter.
6. Fold the extremities of the paper sheet to assure itâ€™s properly closed.
7. Put the salame in the fridge overnight. When ready, remeove the parchment paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar before cutting it into slices of about 1 cm in thickness.

Recipe by Lorenzo Masoero.


## Ingredients

### Caramel sauce
* 2 tbsp of caster sugar
* 60ml of water

### Pudding
* 6 tbsp of caster sugar
* 4 medium eggs
* 500ml of milk
* 3 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
* 30ml of rum
* 70g of amaretti biscuits, crumbled

### To serve
* amaretti biscuits

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4
2. To make the caramel, place the sugar and water in a small saucepan set over a medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil and allow the caramel to darken and thicken. Remove from the heat and divide the caramel between 6 pudding moulds. Set aside
3. Next, place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until the sugar has dissolved and the eggs are pale and airy. Add the milk, cocoa, rum and crumbled amaretti, then whisk until fully combined
4. Pour the mixture into the moulds, then place the moulds in a deep tray filled with water to create a bain-marie. Place in the oven and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through –– use a toothpick to test for doneness: it should come out clean from the centre of one of the puddings
5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours – or better still, overnight – before serving. Serve chilled with a couple of extra amaretti biscuits as a decoration

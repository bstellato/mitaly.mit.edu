## Purpose
Our purpose is “to spread, promote and advance the Italian culture at MIT and in the Boston area, create a network for Italian students at MIT and serve as a link between MIT and Italian Companies, Universities and Associations.”

MITaly was officially recognized by MIT in 2003, but elections and on-campus events were already taking place by as early as 2000.

We strive to facilitate a well-connected network of students who are linked by a shared experience of both MIT and Italian culture. If you’re on campus, come to our events, and if you’re abroad, stay in touch.

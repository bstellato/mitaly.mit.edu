MITaly was very excited to organize a group visit to the most comprehensive exhibition on Leonardo Da Vinci, “Da Vinci – the Genius”,  held at the Museum of Science in Boston.

We had the opportunity to explore Leonardo’s most famous inventions, codices, anatomical studies, displays of his art in actual size, and much more!

Dear MITalians,

we are happy to announce our next event "Italian Professors in Boston: Lessons to learn" in which we are asking prominent Italian faculty members, from renowned Universities of the Boston area, to tell us about their stories, motivations and exceptional academic career paths that brought them here!

We will soon announce the list of speakers...stay tuned!!!

Please, join us for the talks and the following networking event. A light refreshment will be served after the event.

August is finally here, and everyone is leaving the city for a long, summer vacation. At least, everyone would if we were in Italy. Since we live in the US now, we're probably stuck working in the lab.
To try and make you feel at least a bit of the Italian summer vibe, MITaly is organizing a Summer BBQ, in perfect Ferragosto tradition.

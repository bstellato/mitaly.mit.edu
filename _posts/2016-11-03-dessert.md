This event featured special Italian desserts from the regions of Italy in celebration of Columbus Day and the Italian Heritage Month!

We traveled through Italy and tasted the best desserts of each region, including Sfogliatelle from Campania, Gianduiotti from Piedmont, or Cannoli from Sicily.

Along the journey, we learned about the regions representing the desserts and Italian traditions.

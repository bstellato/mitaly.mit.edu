Italian comedy is a classical film genre that has its roots in the late 1950s and has been evolving alongside the greater Italian culture for the last 60 years.

In a three-part event, MITaly presents three carefully selected films representing the Italian comedy at different stages of its evolution. The first movie was “Il Mostro” (The Monster), starring, written, and directed by Roberto Benigni. (All movies feature Italian dialogue with English subtitles).

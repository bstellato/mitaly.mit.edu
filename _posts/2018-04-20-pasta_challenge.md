Given the huge success of the Carbonara Night, the Pasta al Rag√π night, the Pasta al Pesto Night, the Pasta alla Gricia Night AND the Pasta alla Norma, the members of the Italian Student Associations of Boston University, Harvard, MIT and Northeastern organized 6th Edition of this AMAZING challenge!

We prepared four delicious samples from the four different teams and the public voted for the best pasta.
